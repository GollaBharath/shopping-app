# Shopping App Using Basic Python

```
 We put together this ugly mostrocity of code when our programming mam decided to task us with building a shopping app which runs on terminal. We used basic python, did not use functions or OOPS because we were told not to, so please excuse this monster to exist XD.
```

> I had another friend in my team while building this project, we were asked to put this together in a few hours so everything here is an absolute mess, sorry about that lol.

## How to run this?
